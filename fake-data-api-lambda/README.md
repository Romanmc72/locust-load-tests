# Fake Data API Load Test

Launch the stack with `./up.sh` and bring it down with `./down.sh`. Go to [localhost](http://localhost:8089) and enter the number of concurrent users and the URL associated to the API Gateway endpoint that you want to test. This was specifically designed to see how a Lambda-backed AWS API Gateway API would perform. Bare in mind the costs and see the results for yourself.
