# Locust

[Locust](https://locust.io/) is an open source load testing framework. I use it to load test some of the services that I create and see how resilient and fault tolerant they really are.

## In this repo

You should see a buncha folders each aimed at testing a particular stack or service or something. Each will have its own readme and dependencies.
